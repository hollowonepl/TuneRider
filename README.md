TuneRider	v0.3		(c) 2025 hollowone/oftenhide 
============================================================

A simple TUI audio player that can play MP3, FLAC, M4A  and
WAV files directly from your MacOs/Silicon terminal.
 
It comes with two small utilities:

**mp3play** (a 36kB  standalone executable) - that plays single
file with no ui or other interactivity 

**tunerider** (a 600kB standalone executable) - that comes with
file_browsing UI, kind of like Open Cubic Player  in MS-DOS
times (sort of)

Both  programs  can  be  considered a public domain with no 
warranties, support or responsibility from the author  over 
actual usage.

They just work, tho, for me (author),so if it does for you,
then enjoy.

V0.3 vs, V0.2 changes:
- fixed correct visual rendering in light/dark themes of
  the terminal (originally only tested against dark themes)
- added pause/resume for the current track (SPACEBAR key)
- added showing all available metadata (title/year/genre)
  for selected file (TAB key)

===========================================================

V0.2 vs. V0.1 changes:
- it can now continually play whole directories
- it shows metadata of currently played tune 
  (title/author/year/genre)
- few bugs related to folder access (broken links,symlinks)
  fixed, should be more stable to navigate across system
  even if you have limited rights
